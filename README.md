# Install

You __HAVE__ to remove the old config files in your home directory before installing these. I recommend backing them up instead of deleting them, preferably inside of `~/dotfiles.bak` directory.
To install these you will need to place these files inside of `~/dotfiles`. Technically you can put them in any folder as long as you place that folder inside of your home directory.

example:
```
~/
|-- dotfiles/
    |-- .zshrc
    |-- .config/
        |-- alacritty/
            | -- alacritty.toml
```

Files I use (that you will need to move):
 - ~/.zshrc
 - ~/.config/alacritty/alacritty.toml
